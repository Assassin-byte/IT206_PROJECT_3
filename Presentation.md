# Open Source Project Presentation: Blackjack and Teen Patti Game

---

## 1. Project Overview
This project is a C++ implementation of two popular card games: **Blackjack** and **Teen Patti**. It showcases the use of object-oriented programming principles to create an engaging and interactive gaming experience. The project includes features such as player statistics, game mechanics, and file handling for saving and loading game states.

### Why This Project?
- **Educational Value**: Demonstrates advanced programming concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **Practical Application**: Implements real-world game mechanics, making it relatable and fun.
- **Open Source Contribution**: Provides opportunities to enhance and optimize the codebase.

### Key Features:
#### **Blackjack**:
- Player vs. Dealer gameplay.
- Betting system with cash management.
- Leaderboard for high scores.
- Save and load game functionality.

#### **Teen Patti**:
- Multiplayer gameplay.
- Card shuffling and dealing.
- Winner determination based on card values.

## 2. Objectives
- **Understand** the implementation of card games using object-oriented programming.
- **Analyze** the design choices, data structures, and algorithms used in the project.
- **Identify** potential improvements or optimizations in the codebase.
- **Contribute** to the project by raising issues or suggesting enhancements.

## 3. Breadth-Wise Understanding of the Project
### Codebase Structure:
The project is organized into two main modules:
1. **Blackjack**:
   - Located in the `src` folder.
   - Includes classes like `Game`, `Player`, `Dealer`, `Deck`, and `Card`.
   - Implements game mechanics, player statistics, and file handling.
2. **Teen Patti**:
   - Located in the `TeenPatti` folder.
   - Includes classes like `Game`, `Player`, and `Deck`.
   - Focuses on multiplayer gameplay and winner determination.

### Key Components:
- **Card Class**:
  - Represents a playing card with attributes like rank, suit, and value.
- **Deck Class**:
  - Manages a collection of cards, including shuffling and dealing.
- **Player Class**:
  - Tracks player details such as name, hand, cash, and statistics.
- **Game Class**:
  - Implements the main game logic, including rounds, betting, and winner determination.

## 4. Depth-Wise Analysis
### 4.1 Approaches Taken:
- **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - Encapsulation of game logic and player data into modular classes.
  - Inheritance for shared functionality (e.g., `Player` and `Dealer` inherit from `Human`).
- **File Handling**:
  - Binary files are used to save and load game states.
  - High scores are stored in a separate file for leaderboard functionality.
- **Randomization**:
  - Card shuffling is implemented using `std::random_shuffle` for randomness.

### 4.2 Data Structures Used:
- **Vectors**:
  - Used to store cards in the deck and player hands.
- **Strings**:
  - Used for player names and card ranks.
- **Custom Classes**:
  - `Card`, `Deck`, `Player`, and `Game` encapsulate specific functionalities.

### 4.3 Tradeoffs Made:
- **Randomization**:
  - `std::random_shuffle` is used, which is deprecated in modern C++ standards. A better alternative would be `std::shuffle` with a random number generator.
- **File Handling**:
  - Binary files are used for simplicity, but they lack portability and readability compared to text-based formats like JSON or XML.
- **Game Logic**:
  - The game logic is tightly coupled with the `Game` class, making it harder to extend or reuse components independently.

## 5. Findings and Suggestions
### Strengths:
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of responsibilities across classes.
- **Comprehensive Features**: Implements all essential game mechanics.
- **Educational Value**: Demonstrates advanced programming concepts effectively.

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Modernization**:
   - Replace `std::random_shuffle` with `std::shuffle` for better compatibility with modern C++ standards.
2. **Error Handling**:
   - Add robust error handling for file operations and invalid inputs.
3. **Code Reusability**:
   - Decouple game logic from the `Game` class to improve reusability and testability.
4. **Documentation**:
   - Add detailed comments and documentation for better code readability and maintainability.

---

## 6. Contribution
### Potential Contributions:
- **Raise an Issue**:
  - Highlight the use of deprecated `std::random_shuffle` and suggest replacing it with `std::shuffle`.
- **Suggest Enhancements**:
  - Propose improvements in file handling and error handling.
- **Create a Pull Request**:
  - Refactor the `Game` class for better modularity and reusability.
