# **Open Source Project Presentation: Blackjack and Teen Patti Game**

---

## **Welcome!**

Hello everyone, and thank you for joining me today! I’m excited to present our open-source project: **Blackjack and Teen Patti Game**. This project is a **C++ implementation** of two popular card games, showcasing the power of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles to create an engaging, interactive, and feature-rich gaming experience.

This presentation will walk you through the project’s design, implementation, and findings. By the end, you’ll have a clear understanding of how the project works, the approaches taken, and areas for improvement.

## **1. Project Overview**

### **What is the Project About?**
This project implements two classic card games—**Blackjack** and **Teen Patti**—using C++. It demonstrates how advanced programming concepts like **inheritance**, **encapsulation**, and **polymorphism** can be applied to create real-world applications.

### **Why Did We Choose This Project?**
- **Educational Value**: It’s a practical way to learn and demonstrate OOP concepts.
- **Relatable and Fun**: Card games are universally understood, making the project engaging.
- **Open Source Contribution**: It provides opportunities for collaboration and improvement.

### **Key Features**
#### **Blackjack**:
- **Player vs. Dealer Gameplay**: Simulates the classic casino game.
- **Betting System**: Players manage cash and place bets.
- **Leaderboard**: Tracks high scores for competitive play.
- **Save and Load Functionality**: Players can save their progress and resume later.

#### **Teen Patti**:
- **Multiplayer Gameplay**: Supports multiple players for an interactive experience.
- **Card Shuffling and Dealing**: Ensures fairness and randomness.
- **Winner Determination**: Implements logic to decide the winner based on card values.

## **2. Objectives**

### **What Do We Aim to Achieve?**
1. **Understand** the implementation of card games using object-oriented programming.
2. **Analyze** the design choices, data structures, and algorithms used.
3. **Identify** areas for improvement or optimization in the codebase.
4. **Contribute** to the project by raising issues, suggesting enhancements, or submitting pull requests.

## **3. Breadth-Wise Understanding of the Project**

### **Codebase Structure**
The project is divided into two main modules:

1. **Blackjack**:
   - Found in the `src` folder.
   - Includes classes like `Game`, `Player`, `Dealer`, `Deck`, and `Card`.
   - Implements game mechanics, player statistics, and file handling.

2. **Teen Patti**:
   - Found in the `TeenPatti` folder.
   - Includes classes like `Game`, `Player`, and `Deck`.
   - Focuses on multiplayer gameplay and winner determination.

### **Key Components**
- **Card Class**: Represents a playing card with attributes like rank, suit, and value.
- **Deck Class**: Manages a collection of cards, including shuffling and dealing.
- **Player Class**: Tracks player details such as name, hand, cash, and statistics.
- **Game Class**: Implements the main game logic, including rounds, betting, and winner determination.

## **4. Depth-Wise Analysis**

### **4.1 Approaches Taken**
- **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - Encapsulation of game logic and player data into modular classes.
  - Inheritance for shared functionality (e.g., `Player` and `Dealer` inherit from `Human`).
- **File Handling**:
  - Binary files are used to save and load game states.
  - High scores are stored in a separate file for leaderboard functionality.
- **Randomization**:
  - Card shuffling is implemented using `std::random_shuffle` to ensure fairness.

### **4.2 Data Structures Used**
- **Vectors**: Used to store cards in the deck and player hands.
- **Strings**: Used for player names and card ranks.
- **Custom Classes**: `Card`, `Deck`, `Player`, and `Game` encapsulate specific functionalities.

### **4.3 Tradeoffs Made**
- **Randomization**:
  - `std::random_shuffle` is used, which is deprecated in modern C++ standards. A better alternative would be `std::shuffle` with a random number generator.
- **File Handling**:
  - Binary files are simple but lack portability compared to formats like JSON or XML.
- **Game Logic**:
  - The game logic is tightly coupled with the `Game` class, making it harder to extend or reuse components independently.

## **5. Findings and Suggestions**

### **Strengths**
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of responsibilities across classes.
- **Comprehensive Features**: Implements all essential game mechanics.
- **Educational Value**: Demonstrates advanced programming concepts effectively.

### **Areas for Improvement**
1. **Modernization**:
   - Replace `std::random_shuffle` with `std::shuffle` for better compatibility with modern C++ standards.
2. **Error Handling**:
   - Add robust error handling for file operations and invalid inputs.
3. **Code Reusability**:
   - Decouple game logic from the `Game` class to improve reusability and testability.
4. **Documentation**:
   - Add detailed comments and documentation for better code readability and maintainability.

## **6. Contribution**

### **How Can You Contribute?**
- **Raise an Issue**:
  - Highlight the use of deprecated `std::random_shuffle` and suggest replacing it with `std::shuffle`.
- **Suggest Enhancements**:
  - Propose improvements in file handling and error handling.
- **Create a Pull Request**:
  - Refactor the `Game` class for better modularity and reusability.

## **8. Q&A Preparation**

### **Sample Questions**
1. **Breadth-Wise**:
   - What are the main components of the project, and how do they interact?
   - How is the deck of cards managed in the game?
2. **Depth-Wise**:
   - What data structures are used to store player hands and the deck?
   - How does the project handle randomization for card shuffling?
3. **Tradeoffs**:
   - Why was binary file handling chosen over text-based formats?
   - What are the limitations of the current implementation?
