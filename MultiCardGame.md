## **3. Breadth-Wise Understanding of the Project**

### **Codebase Structure**
The project is divided into two main modules:

1. **Blackjack**:
   - Found in the `src` folder.
   - Includes classes like `Game`, `Player`, `Dealer`, `Deck`, and `Card`.
   - Implements game mechanics, player statistics, and file handling.

2. **Teen Patti**:
   - Found in the `TeenPatti` folder.
   - Includes classes like `Game`, `Player`, and `Deck`.
   - Focuses on multiplayer gameplay and winner determination.

### **Key Components**
- **Card Class**: Represents a playing card with attributes like rank, suit, and value.
- **Deck Class**: Manages a collection of cards, including shuffling and dealing.
- **Player Class**: Tracks player details such as name, hand, cash, and statistics.
- **Game Class**: Implements the main game logic, including rounds, betting, and winner determination.

## **4. Depth-Wise Analysis**

### **4.1 Approaches Taken**
- **Object-Oriented Design**:
  - Encapsulation of game logic and player data into modular classes.
  - Inheritance for shared functionality (e.g., `Player` and `Dealer` inherit from `Human`).
- **File Handling**:
  - Binary files are used to save and load game states.
  - High scores are stored in a separate file for leaderboard functionality.
- **Randomization**:
  - Card shuffling is implemented using `std::random_shuffle` to ensure fairness.

### **4.2 Data Structures Used**
- **Vectors**: Used to store cards in the deck and player hands.
- **Strings**: Used for player names and card ranks.
- **Custom Classes**: `Card`, `Deck`, `Player`, and `Game` encapsulate specific functionalities.

### **4.3 Tradeoffs Made**
- **Randomization**:
  - `std::random_shuffle` is used, which is deprecated in modern C++ standards. A better alternative would be `std::shuffle` with a random number generator.
- **File Handling**:
  - Binary files are simple but lack portability compared to formats like JSON or XML.
- **Game Logic**:
  - The game logic is tightly coupled with the `Game` class, making it harder to extend or reuse components independently.

## **5. Findings and Suggestions**

### **Strengths**
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of responsibilities across classes.
- **Comprehensive Features**: Implements all essential game mechanics.
- **Educational Value**: Demonstrates advanced programming concepts effectively.

### **Areas for Improvement**
1. **Modernization**:
   - Replace `std::random_shuffle` with `std::shuffle` for better compatibility with modern C++ standards.
2. **Error Handling**:
   - Add robust error handling for file operations and invalid inputs.
3. **Code Reusability**:
   - Decouple game logic from the `Game` class to improve reusability and testability.
4. **Documentation**:
   - Add detailed comments and documentation for better code readability and maintainability.
